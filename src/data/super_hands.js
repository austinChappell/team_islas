    quote: 'The most successful teachers, musically or otherwise, reach students through myriad techniques and strategies. Not the least of which include a passion for a student\'s potential and ability to learn, uncompromising expectations, and most certainly, a well-crafted plan for systemic improvement. Doug Bush\'s career as a performer, teacher and arranger speaks to each of these areas, and provides a framework for a lifetime of experiences dedicated to shaping young percussionist minds. Mr. Bush does an outstanding job of structuring Super Hands in such a way that a percussion student can navigate progressively through the book with or without the help of a private lesson teacher. From the clearly annotated key, to the exercise descriptors that keep the technical and musical goals at the forefront of student learning, this book is an excellent addition to the modern rudimental percussion method and solo repertoire. Well done, Mr. Bush!',

    quote: 'As a marching percussion specialist I am always looking for educational resources that students can use in independent study. Super Hands is the most pedagogically sound compilation of material I have found for intermediate to advanced rudimental percussion students. The exercises in Super Hands cover a breadth of skills and provide variety in their approach as they build one skill set upon another. The etudes and solos in the book are educationally sound while catering to the interests of modern marching percussionists. Super Hands provides an excellent framework for marching percussion lesson and independent study programs.',

    quote: 'Super Hands has been THE difference maker for my intermediate level students! The exercises develop logically into etudes that are actually fun to play. Mastering these intermediate level skills on a drum will have a huge pay off on keyboards, timpani, or drum set. Perfectly paced and simply structured, Super Hands is a modern solution to an age-old problem: transforming beginner players into advanced musicians. Use the exercises and etudes in class, private lessons, or as fun material for your students to drum through on their own.',

    quote: 'Finally, a method book that can fulfill the spectrum of all rudimental skill level challenges! I have been piloting this method book with my middle school and high school students for almost a year now, and I have seen the results! I use Super Hands in my high school program as a year-round method book, not only to improve rudiments and chop-building, but also as a sight-reading resource to improve their rhythmic vocabulary. The results are evident, as my high school students are reading better and executing rudimental skill-sets with more precision. I use the short rudimental isolation exercises with my middle school students, which has helped their skills improve one hand at a time. As a result, I\'ve noticed their abilities to combine hands has become more of an effortless transition. From basic stroke and sticking applications, to syncopations and rest figures, this book has it all. I\'m even able to use exercises like "Shups" and "Jedi 8s" for individual assessment, and they\'re perfect to audition bass line or cymbal line students! A huge THANK YOU to Doug Bush and his vision with Super Hands. This book is a true testament of Doug Bush\'s versatile teaching and composition styles, and we are all fortunate to be able to experience a glimpse of a true master\'s mind.',
