  'As a young percussionist, one of my most profound experiences was working through the book Master Studies by the late jazz legend Joe Morello. I have since worked through this book countless times and it has helped to plug the gaps between my drum set and rudimental playing. Many of the concepts presented in Master Hands are extensions of the concepts presented in Master Studies, and are further influenced by my experiences on drum set and marching / teaching drum corps. I highly recommend playing through Master Studies before playing through Master Hands. Pay special attention to the preface of Master Studies where Joe gives his thoughts on technique and use of the metronome. These words are just as true today as they were when he originally penned them in 1983.',

    quote: 'These etudes are not your typical rudimental rams, but are beginning to teach players the concept of being able to take stickings and move them around in any musical way they so desire. This leads us to think more like a jazz musician who is able to weave in and out phrases effortlessly, as opposed to "the marching snare drummer" who plays what\'s on the page.',

    quote: 'As a student of Doug Bush, I had the privilege of playing his music. In Master Hands, musicians will find a collection of Mr. Bush’s beats that not only promote the development of intermediate drumming skills, but are also fun to play. What I love most about Master Hands is that it includes a series of exercises that are extremely applicable to the music. The exercises target fundamental skills and put them in realistic musical contexts, which makes for a smooth transition into playing challenging music. I would highly recommend this book to any percussionist.',

Each exercise and etude in his new book, Master Hands, is an exciting journey that provides the player with new technical, musical, and rhythmic challenges. The “24 Rules” alone are countless years of wisdom and experience. Master Hands is the perfect book to bridge the gap between intermediate and advanced rudimental drumming.',
