This leads us to think more like a jazz musician who is able to weave in and out phrases effortlessly, as opposed to "the marching snare drummer" who plays what\'s on the page.',

    quote: 'As a student of Doug Bush, I had the privilege of playing his music. In Master Hands, musicians will find a collection of Mr. Bush’s beats that not only promote the development of intermediate drumming skills, but are also fun to play. What I love most about Master Hands is that it includes a series of exercises that are extremely applicable to the music. The exercises target fundamental skills and put them in realistic musical contexts, which makes for a smooth transition into playing challenging music. I would highly recommend this book to any percussionist.',

Each exercise and etude in his new book, Master Hands, is an exciting journey that provides the player with new technical, musical, and rhythmic challenges. The “24 Rules” alone are countless years of wisdom and experience. Master Hands is the perfect book to bridge the gap between intermediate and advanced rudimental drumming.',

At B your right hand will play this exact accent pattern on the rim. Notice at B the dynamic is mezzo piano (mp). This section should have a light drum and bass - type feel.',

    description: '7 Step Process - This solo was written for my good friend and master teacher Chad Gibson. If you are playing it at 125 BPM the metric change at B will bring it to 180 BPM. Notice that the speed of the 16th notes in measure 21 is the same speed as the triplets in measure 22 and that the accents in measure 56 will become the quarter note accents in measure 57.',

When playing a solo that is very rhythmically demanding, it is important to transition carefully from one technique to the next as to perform the rhythms accurately and without slurring. There are several complex stickings in this solo that will, in order to ensure they sound smooth at fast tempos, require patience to learn.',
