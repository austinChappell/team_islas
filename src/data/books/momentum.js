  'Momentum is a collection of exercises, etudes, and solos designed to develop the physical and mental control necessary for self-expression through two-mallet percussion. The exercises are organized to develop a balanced variety of skills in an achievable progression.  The etudes are short musical examples intended to transfer recently acquired skills to a more musical context.  And finally the solos are physically challenging, musically mature, and composed to sound cool enough to be worth the effort.  To those disciplined enough to complete the exercise, etudes, and solos of Momentum, the two-mallet universe is yours!',

    quote: "MOMENTUM is an outstanding, thoughtful, and innovative method for two mallets.  Patricia's creative approach to exercises combines rhythmic vocabulary and stick control concepts that will not only be fruitful for intermediate players but will also fill in gaps for more advanced players.  The progressive etudes are a perfect summation of her pedagogical concepts and stand apart as completely unique in the two mallet pedagogy.  Finally, the diverse and beautiful collection of solos are just great music. This whole book is a breath of fresh air and a singular contribution to two mallet methods and repertoire!",

    quote: "Patricia Islas' new marimba method book, Momentum, is outstanding!  These are not simple one and two-page marimba etudes, but ten advanced two-mallet solos with developmental exercises and practice etudes.  Most importantly these solos are musically progressive, hip and engaging.  Momentum is a perfect combination for students of all ages as well as their teachers.  Congratulations to Patricia Islas!",
