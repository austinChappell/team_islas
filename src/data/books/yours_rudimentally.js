  '“Yours Rudimentally” is dedicated to Mr. John S. Pratt, one of the most prolific and influential rudimental composers of all time. This duet for marching snare drum and marching bass drum is meant to be both a celebration and tribute to Pratt’s life and music. The piece seeks to immortalize many of the classic Pratt themes with a modern style.',
