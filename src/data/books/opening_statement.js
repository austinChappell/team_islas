  'Opening Statement is a collection of beginner to intermediate snare drum solos. For the past 20 years, I have found a need for beginning to intermediate snare literature with greater variety. Something that included open and closed rolls, different rhythms, dynamics, stickings, flams and yet was accessible and easy to read for beginning snare drummers. Opening Statement represents four years of composing, testing and receiving critical feedback from several Texas High School percussion programs ranging in size and ability level.',

Doug has done such an amazing job writing these solos in a manner that is educational yet still fresh and fun. This book will lead your students straight into "Super Hands" and will set up the solid foundation needed for "Master Hands." It is a must-have for every band program.',

Each etude helps to develop student\'s knowledge and understanding of modern-day rhythms, dynamics, and timing, while also being enjoyable to learn and perform.
